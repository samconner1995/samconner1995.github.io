            <p class="content-block">Through use of steering vectors and finite state machines, dynamic behavior is achieved! Computer players look at their internal state and the environment around them, and calculate their desired movement vectors and actions in real time.</p>

            <p class="content-block">Using primarily weighted randomness, a diverse set of enemy armies, characters, equipment and upgrade choices are generated at the start of each run. The players navigate through these choices in between battles. Each playthrough is different!</p>

            <p class="content-block"> Data is collected in the background in real time during battles, players' damage dealt, damage received, and their efficiency as a commander are among the data collected. This is then processed and shown to the players after each battle. Players love validating their strategies through data! </p>

            <p class="content-block"> Each player's body is broken up into 6 pieces. These pieces are animated independently via custom animation code. Players' legs run, sidestep, and backpeddle. The force of firing a gun travels from the gun through the arms to the shoulders.</p>
